// Comments 

Comments are not "pure good". Indeed, comments are, at best, a necessary evil.
If your our programming languages were expressive enough, or if we had the talent
to subtly wield those languages to express our intent, we should not need comments 
very much--perhaps not at all. 

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
Inaccurate comments are far worse than no comments at all.
