//Objects and Data Structures 

Hiding implementation is not just a matter of putting a layer of functions between the variables. 
Hiding implementation is about abstraction.

Example:
public interface Vehicle {
    double getFuelTankCapacityInGallon();
    double getGallonsOfGasoline();
}

public interface Vehicle {
    double getPercentFuelRemaining();
}

<<Data/Object anti-symmetry>>
Objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose functions that operate on that data.
Data structure expose their data and have no meaningful functions.

Procedural code (code using data structure) makes it easy to add new functions without
changing the existing data structure. OO code, on the other hand, make it easy to add
new classes without changing existing functions.

The complement is also true:
Procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change.
OO code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change.

<<Data Transfer Objects>>
A data structure where a class with public variables and no functions is sometimes called a
data transfer object, or DTO.
DTO are very useful structures, especially when communicating with databases or parsing messages
from socktes, and so on. 

<<Active Record>>
Special forms of DTO. They are data structures with public (or bean-accessed) variables; but they tipically
have navigation methods like save and find. 
Sometimes data structures are treate as objects by putting business rule methods in them (creating a hybrid
between a data structure and an object)
