//Formatting

Code formatting is important. It is too impoprtant to ignore and
it is too important to treat religiously.
Code formatting is about communication, and communication is the 
professional developer's first order of business.

The coding style and readability set precedents that contune to 
affect maintainability and extensibility long after the original Code
has been changed beyond recognition. 

<<Vertical Formatting>>
Small files are usually easier to understand than large files are

<<Vertical Openness between concepts>>
Each line represents an expression or a clause, and each group of lines
represents a complete thought.
Those thoughts should be separated from each other with blank lines.

<<vertical density>>
Lines of code that are tightly related should apper vertically dense.

<<Variable declarations>>
Variables should be declared as close to ther usage as possible.
