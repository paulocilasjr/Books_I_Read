//Boundaries

<<Exploring and Learning boundaries>>
<<Learning tests are better than free>>
Not only are learning tests free, they have a positive return on investiment.
When there are new releases of the third-party package, we run the 
learning tests to see whether there are behavioral differences.

Whether you need the learning provided by the learning tsts or not,
a clean boundary should be supported by a set of outbound tests that
exercise the interface the same way the production code does. Without 
these boundary tests to ease the migration, we might be tempted to stay 
with the old version longer than we should.
