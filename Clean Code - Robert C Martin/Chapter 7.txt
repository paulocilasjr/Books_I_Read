//Error Handling

<<Use excepetions rather than return codes>>
Is better to throw an exception when you encounter an error. The calling code is cleaner. 
Its logic is not obscured by error handling.

<<Write your try-catch-finally statement first>>
This helps you define what the user of that code should expect, no matter what goes wrong
with the code that is executed in the try.

The special case pattern [Fowler]: create a class or configure an object so that it handles
a special case for you. When you do, the client code doesn't have to deal withe exceptional 
behavior. That Behavior is encapsulated in the special case object.

<<Don't return NULL>>
When we return null, we are essentially creating work for ourselves and foisting problems  
upon our callers.
If you are tempted to return null from a method consider throwing an exception or returning
a special case object instead.

<<Don't pass Null>>
Passing null into methods is worse. Unless you are working with an API which expects you to pass null.

In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is passed by a caller 
accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid passing null by default.
