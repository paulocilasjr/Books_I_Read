//Unit tests

<<The Three Laws of TDD>>
First Law: You may not write production code until you have written a failing
unit test.

Second law: You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail,
and not compiling if failing

Third law: you may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass
the currently failing test

**The tests and the production code are written together, with the test just 
a few seconds ahead of the production code.

<<Keeping tests clean>>
Test code is just as important as production code.

If you don't keep your tests clean, you will lose them.
What makes a clean test? three things: Readability, Readability, and Readability
