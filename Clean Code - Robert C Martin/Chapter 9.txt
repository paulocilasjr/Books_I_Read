//Unit tests

<<The Three Laws of TDD>>
First Law: You may not write production code until you have written a failing
unit test.

Second law: You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail,
and not compiling if failing

Third law: you may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass
the currently failing test

**The tests and the production code are written together, with the test just 
a few seconds ahead of the production code.

<<Keeping tests clean>>
Test code is just as important as production code.

If you don't keep your tests clean, you will lose them.
What makes a clean test? three things: Readability, Readability, and Readability

There are things that you might never do in a production environment that are
perfectly fine in a test environment. 

<<Single assert per test rule>>

<<Single concept per test>>
Better rule is that we want to test a single concept in each test function.
Merging multople tests into sema function forces the reader to figure out 
why each section is there and what is being tested by that section.
Minimize the number of asserts per concept and test just one concept per
test function

F.I.R.S.T : clean tests follow five rules
Fast
Independent 
Repeatable
Self-validating
Timely
